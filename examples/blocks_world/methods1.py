In each Pyhop planning method, the first argument is the current state (this
is analogous to Python methods, in which the first argument is the class
instance). The rest of the arguments must match the arguments of the task
that the method is for. For example, ('pickup', b1) has a method
get_m(state,b1), as shown below.
